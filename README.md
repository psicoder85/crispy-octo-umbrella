# Python Port Scanner Overview

A simple port scanner built with Python to identify open ports and detect services running on a target machine. This tool is designed for network security testing and service discovery.

## Features

- **Port Scanning:** Scan a range of ports or specific ports on a target machine.
- **Service Detection:** Identify which services are running on open ports.
- **Multi-threading:** Speed up the scanning process by using multiple threads.
- **Reporting:** Generate a simple report of open ports and detected services.

## Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher.
- **Libraries:** This project uses only the Python standard library. No additional external libraries are required.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   
   ```bash
      cd port_scanner
   
4. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**
   
   ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
5. **Install Dependencies**
Since this project only relies on the Python standard library, there are no additional packages to install. However, if you extend the project to include external libraries, you can add them to the requirements.txt file and install them using:

   ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt

6. **Usage**
To run the port scanner, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py <target_ip> <port1,port2,port3>

  ### Examples
- Scan specific ports:
   ```bash
      python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 22,80,443

 This command will scan ports 22, 80, and 443 on the target IP address 192.168.1.1.

- Scan a range of ports:
   ```bash
     python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
   
This command will scan ports 1 through 10 on the target IP address 192.168.1.1.

## Testing
To ensure the functionality of the port scanner, you can create test scripts in the tests/ directory. Example test cases might include:

Verifying that the scanner correctly identifies open and closed ports.
Checking the scanner's behavior with invalid inputs.
